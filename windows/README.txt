Anyone is free to use/replicate/distrubute the code with changes!!! (just dont sue me)
Commits are appreciated! Please try to keep the code formatting consistent
It is not recommended to run this on your personal computer unless you understand what the program does.
To add on to the above, please either run it in a virtual computer (ex VMWare or Windows Sandbox) or during the competition! (but understand the risks lol)
If you are going to use it during the competition, please don't blindly click "yes" to everything. Take time to understand what is going on behind the scenes so as not to brick your image.
